# Requirements: pygame,  Python v3 or greater<br>
There currently have been four previous versions. This is the one I prefer as it lists the currently playing song and shows the files so that the display remains until the user finishes reviewing it.<br>
.
# Launching the app <br>
Open a terminal at the location of the script <br>
python3 pvm6.py <br>
<br>
To best use this script before launching the script, place the script one directory below your Music directory. In this way, when opening a directory in the script, the only thing needed to enter for the directory is:\> Music <br>
